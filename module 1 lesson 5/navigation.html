                    So sarcastically talking i love to do completely everything. but the things i love to do the most is
                    playing sports, I am mostly active in every sports around me . I love playing basketball, football,
                    badminton , table tennis and many much more.

                    While playing basketball, I really get to have a moment to feel my self free from the darkness of
                    the earth, the crowd between us and even my uneasty brain. In my opinion its such a relaxing sport
                    and at the same time a refreshing exercise at the same time.
